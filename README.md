# iitd-proxylogin
Dependency free Python script for logging in to IIT Delhi proxy service.

_iitd-proxylogin_ is heavily inspired from [this script](https://github.com/abhishek4747/Proxy-login)â€”which is 5 years old, and the author has been inactive for a long time, so I created a fresh repo instead of sending a pull request. Changes I made are the following 
- Ported the code to Python 3.
- Added support for config file and interactive mode so that the password does not get leaked to the shell history.
- Added support for different CLI switches for increased usability.


## Usage

```console
sumit@HAL9000:~/Sysadmin/iitd-proxylogin$ python3 proxylogin.py 
usage: proxylogin.py [-h] (-c CONFIG | -i) [-r] [-s] [-p]
